# MeanGirlsQuiz
Mean Girls BuzzFeed-esque "Which Character Are You?" quiz.

My first exposure to object-oriented programming, created in 2019 for my AP Computer Science Principles exam. 

In this program, I created a class Character for the main characters in Mean Girls. I instantiated them and gave each character a list of "correct" answers that correspond to them. Throughout the quiz, I ask the user questions, and, based on their responses, I increment scores in a dictionary. At the end, I find the maximum value and return its key -- the character the user is most like.
